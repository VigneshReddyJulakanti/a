            ************* UAPA *******************
! Unlawful activities prevention act     ( simply anti terrorism act )

--> firstly it was amended in 1967 and after 6 more amendments it was finally amended in 2019

--> For prosecution under UAPA , permission of both MHA(ministry of home affairs) and the respective state government is needed

--> To seize any property that proceeds to terrorism , NIA(national investigation agency) need the written consent of state DGP .
    but after amendment , they can seize property by obtaining the consent from DGP of NIA and further bypassing the state DGP

--> normally police need to investigate a case in 60 - 90 days , submit of a chargesheet failing leads to the default bail of accused 
    where as the pre-charge sheet time to the accused in UAPA is extended to 180 days


**
--> normal bail rules do not apply to the one accused under UAPA
